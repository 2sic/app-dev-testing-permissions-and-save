<h1>3 - Semi-Public forms</h1>
<div>
  These are forms which are not allowed for public users, but for registered users or users in a certain group. <br>
  To test this, we must create a user-group and give only these the following permissions:
</div>
<ol>
  <li>read schema</li>
  <li>create (full-create, not draft)</li>
  <li>edit-draft only</li>
  <li>delete</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<div>
  We won't run all tests, but we want to be sure that the system correctly handles users as not anonymous, <br>
  and that anonymous are not the same as users in a group. So we'll just want these tests:
</div>
<ol>
    <li>an anonymous user should not be able to edit</li>
    <li>an anonymous user should not be able to create</li>
    <li>a user in that group should be able to create - both draft and live</li>
    <li>a user in that group should only be able to edit into draft, not live</li>
    <li>a user in that group should be able to delete</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Item @Content.EntityTitle</h3>
@Edit.Toolbar(Content, actions: "new,edit,delete", contentType: "@Content.EntityType")
<div>
    <div>
        <label>Title</label>:
        <strong class="item-@Content.EntityTitle">@Content.EntityTitle</strong>
    </div>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>List @Content.EntityTitle</h3>
<ol>
@foreach(var cont in AsDynamic(Data["Default"])){
    <li>
        <strong class="list-@Content.EntityTitle">@cont.EntityTitle</strong>
        @Edit.Toolbar(cont, actions: "edit,new,add,remove,delete", contentType: "@Content.EntityType")
    </li>
}
</ol>
